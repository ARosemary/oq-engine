# PEER test "FAULT 1" model
# The original data provided in the PEER Report ("Verification of Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis Computer Programs", 
# Patricia Thomas, Ivan Wong, Norman Abrahamson, Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center) are the following:
# b value = -0.9
# slip rate (m/yr) = 2e-3
# rigidity (N/m2) = 3e10
# fault length  (m) = 25*1e3
# fault width (m) = 12*1e3
# From the above data we can calculate the seismic moment rate (N*m/yr):
# seismic moment rate = rigidity * fault length * fault width * slip rate
#
# For test set 1 case 8, the magnitude density function is assumed to be a delta function at M = 6.0.
# We can then compute the corresponding occurrence rate, calculating first the incremental a value assuming M=6 as the only possible rupture. 
# By imposing the following equality:
# 10^(a incremental + b value * M) * 10(1.5 * M + 9.05) = seismic moment rate
# we can derive the following equation:
# a incremental = log10(seismic moment rate) - (1.5 + b value) * M - 9.05
# from the incremental a value we can then derive the cumulative a value, using the following formula:
# cumulative a value = incremental a value - log10(-b value * log(10))
# the resulting cumulative a value is 3.2888. By defining the magnitude frequency distribution of the fault to have Mmin=Mmax=M=6, 
# we can define a delta function as requested by the test and with the appropriate occurrence rate.
