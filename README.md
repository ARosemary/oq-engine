# OpenQuake Engine

![OpenQuake Logo](https://github.com/gem/oq-infrastructure/raw/master/logos/oq-logo.png)

The **OpenQuake Engine** is an open source application that allows users to compute **seismic hazard** and **seismic risk** of earthquakes on a global scale. It runs on Linux, macOS and Windows, on laptops, workstations, standalone servers and multi-node clusters.

## OpenQuake Engine version 2.1 (Benioff)

Starting from OpenQuake version 2.0 we have introduced a "code name" to honour earthquake scientists.

The code name for version 2.1 is **Benioff**, in memory of [Hugo Benioff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Benioff).
