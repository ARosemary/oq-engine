| Test ID | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| case_1  | Test the use of IMT-dependent weights in the GMC logic tree | 
| case_2  | Test the use of a rather small discretisation for MFDs | 
| case_3  | Source model with one point source The GMC LT contains two GMMs | 
| case_4  | Source model with one simple fault source | 
| case_5  | Test the option of discarding from the `job.ini` some TR as shown [here](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/20200312_table/openquake/qa_tests_data/event_based/case_5/job.ini#L33s)  | 
| case_6  | Check we calculate only hazard curves from EB | 
| case_7  | Test a simple case with logic tree sampling | 
| case_8  | Test EB with a non-parametric source | 
| case_9  | Test EB hazard for San-Jose (CRI) | 
| case_10 | Test EB hazard for Bogota (COL)  | 
| case_11 | Missing :^) |
| case_12 | Test a SSM with sources from 2 TRs | 
| case_13 | *unclear*| 
| case_14 |  | 
| case_15 |  | 
| case_16 |  | 
| case_17 |  | 
| case_18 |  | 
| case_19 |  | 
| case_20 |  | 
| case_21 | Test the use of a source model containing a cluster | 
| case_22 | Test the use of the [SplitSigmaGMPE](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/blob/master/openquake/hazardlib/gsim/mgmpe/split_sigma_gmpe.py) modifiable GMPE | 
| case_23 | In this test we infer the region from the exposure model | 
| case_24 | Test the use of the `shift_hypo` option | 
| case_25 | Test the use of multiple files for the definition of a source models |
