The OpenQuake Engine software provides calculation and assessment of seismic hazard, risk and decision-making tools via the data, methods and standards that are being developed by **<a href="http://www.globalquakemodel.org" target="_blank">GEM</a>** (Global Earthquake Model) and its collaborators.

The seismic hazard calculations of the OpenQuake Engine are powered by the **<a href="http://github.com/gem/oq-hazardlib" target="_blank">OpenQuake Hazard Library</a>** and
 **<a href="http://github.com/gem/oq-risklib" target="_blank">OpenQuake Risk Library</a>**
Both libraries were built by the OpenQuake team to serve as a fast, stable, and lightweight alternative to existing risk and hazard libraries.
