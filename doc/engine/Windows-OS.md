We are currently not supporting an installation of OpenQuake directly on Windows operating systems, however we can recommend this workaround using VirtualBox.

If you are running a Windows operating system (xp, Vista, 7, 8) we suggest that you use a virtual machine with an installation of Ubuntu to run the OpenQuake engine.

* Download and install [VirtualBox 4.3](http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## Install Ubuntu and OpenQuake from scratch

* Download and mount to VirtualBox an ISO of [Ubuntu 12.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download)
* Continue with the [OpenQuake 1.0](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/wiki/Installing-the-OpenQuake-Engine-1.0) or the [OpenQuake nightly build](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/wiki/Installing-the-OpenQuake-Engine-Nightly) installation instructions
