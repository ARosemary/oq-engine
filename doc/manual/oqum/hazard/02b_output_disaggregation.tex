The \glsdesc{acr:oqe} output of a disaggregation analysis corresponds to the
combination of a hazard curve and a multidimensional matrix containing the
results of the disaggregation. If the disaggregation calculation is configured
to produce results including disaggregation by source, then the list of outputs
would display the following:

\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single, commandchars=\\\{\}, fontsize=\small]
user@ubuntu:~$ oq engine --lo <calc_id>
id | name
\textcolor{red}{3 | Disaggregation Outputs}
\textcolor{black}{4 | Disaggregation by Source}
\textcolor{black}{5 | Full Report}
\textcolor{black}{6 | Hazard Curves}
\textcolor{black}{7 | Seismic Source Groups}
\end{Verbatim}
%\input{oqum/hazard/verbatim/output_disaggregation}

Running \texttt{-{}-export-output} to export the disaggregation results will produce individual files for each IMT, probability of exceedence and logic tree realisation. In the following inset we show an example of the nrml file used to represent the different disaggregation matrices (highlighted in red) produced by
\gls{acr:oqe}:
