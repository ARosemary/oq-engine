The Event Based PSHA calculator computes and stores stochastic event sets and
the corresponding ground motion fields.

This calculator can also produce hazard curves and hazard maps exactly in the
same way as done using the Classical PSHA calculator.

The inset below shows an example of the list of results provided by the
\gls{acr:oqe} at the end of an event-based PSHA calculation:

\input{oqum/hazard/verbatim/output_event_based}

This list in the inset above contains a set of ruptures (in green)
and their corresponding sets of ground motion fields (in red).

Exporting the outputs from the ruptures will produce, for each
realisation, a NRML file containing a collection of ruptures.
Below is an example:

\input{oqum/hazard/verbatim/output_ses}

The text in red shows the part which describes the generated
stochastic event sets and the investigation time covered. Inside the
<SES> tag there is a list of integers (a single integer in this example)
which are unique IDs for the seismic events associated to the rupture.
In general a rupture can occur more than once and the number of events
is given by the multiplicity attribute (in this case 1).

The text in green emphasises the portion of the text used to describe a
rupture. The information provided describes entirely the geometry of the
rupture as well as its rupturing properties (e.g. rake, magnitude). The
rupture ID is an integer that represents each rupture uniquely: it should
not be confused with the event ID, because the multiplicity of a rupture
can be different than 1.

Exporting the outputs from the gmfs will produce an xml file for each
realisation containing the corresponding ground motion fields. Below is an
example of a gmf collection nrml file containing one ground motion field:

\input{oqum/hazard/verbatim/output_gmf}

The `sourcegroups` output produces a csv file listing the tectonic region
types involved in the calculation and the effective number of ruptures
generated by each of them. An example of such a file is shown below.

\input{oqum/hazard/verbatim/output_sourcegroups}
