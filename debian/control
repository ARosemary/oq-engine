Description:  Risklib is an opensource library for seismic risk assessment, which includes
 several modules capable of calculating losses and damage distribution for a
 scenario earthquake (deterministic event) or probabilistic risk from all the
 possible events that might occur in a region within a certain time span
 (probabilistic hazard). The main outputs of this library are loss statistics,
 loss maps, loss curves, damage distribution and collapse maps.
 Risklib aims at becoming an open and comprehensive tool for seismic risk
 analysis. The GEM Foundation (http://www.globalquakemodel.org/) supports the
 development of the library by adding the most common methodologies amongst
 the seismic risk modelers. Comments, suggestions and criticisms from the
 community are always very welcome.
