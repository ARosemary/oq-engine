Description: Set standard-conforming-strings = off in postgresql.conf ?
Extended_description: python-oq-engine requires either standard-conforming-strings = off in the postgres configuration file or a patch.\n\nYour postgresql configuration file currently has standard-conforming-strings = on.\n\nIf you need to keep standard-conforming-strings = on then you must apply a patch to python-django otherwise python-oq-engine will not work. See https://github.com/gem/oq-engine/wiki/ubuntu-python-django-patch for instructions.\n\nIf you choose 'Yes' now, this installation script will set standard-conforming-strings = off in the postgres configuration file otherwise we will leave your configuration file unchanged and continue installing the oq-engine; you must apply the patch or manually edit the configuration file before using the engine.
